# JMU CS VM Configuration Tool

**WORK IN PROGRESS** This is NOT the tool currently deployed. It is an attempt at
rewriting the existing script using better software development practices.

See [TODO](TODO.md) for a list of tasks left to be done.

Wish me luck.

This is tool used for wrapping the Ansible playbooks on virtual machines
in the JMU Department of Computer Science.
